## Install

1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Create virtual environment if desired
3. Install dependencies in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/TimestampConverter/blob/main/requirements.txt).
4. Ensure [`icon.ico`](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/TimestampConverter/blob/main/icon.ico) 
   is in the same directory as [`main.py`](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/TimestampConverter/blob/main/main.py).
5. Run [`main.py`](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/TimestampConverter/blob/main/main.py)!

## Usage

Once you run the program, a window will pop up and quickly disappear. 
To use it, copy a timestamp to the clipboard, for example `1629753699` to your 
clipboard by copying and pasting that number to your clipboard. A window will
